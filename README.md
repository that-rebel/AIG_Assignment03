room leads the agent to an empty room at the end and hence rewards the agent with (-10) reward points. The other room will lead to to a 
doorway of two more doors (rewarding the agent with (5)points); one takes the agent directly to the treasure room awarding the agent 
(2)reward point, while the other leads to the empty room, and the agent is rewarded with (-2) points.
